# Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project.

## Installing Dependencies

Before starting the project, you need to install the required dependencies. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install all the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Running the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```
If you want to start the server and automatically open the app in a new browser tab, use the following command:
```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```
